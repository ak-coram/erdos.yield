# erdos.yield

Python's [generator/yield](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) feature in Clojure and ClojureScript to generate lazy sequences.

How is it different from [clj-generators](https://github.com/aengelberg/clj-generators) and [clj-yield](https://github.com/jpalmucci/clj-yield)? It is much simpler with lower overhead, because it does not depend on core.async or threading in the background. It does simple term rewriting to change imperative style code to functional sequence compositions.

## Usage

Use the `(gen-seq)` macro to create a lazy sequence. Invocations of `(yield)` in the macro sets the next return value of the sequence.

For example, `(gen-seq (yield 1) (yield 2))` will return `(1 2)`. A more complex example:

```Clojure
(gen-seq
 (dotimes [i 3]
   (yield i))
 (yield "Hello")
 (doseq [c "Greetings"]
   (yield c))
 (loop [i 3]
   (when (pos? i)
     (yield i)
     (recur (dec i))))
 (yield "End."))
```

Outputs:

```Clojure
(0 1 2 "Hello" \G \r \e \e \t \i \n \g \s \3 \2 \1 "End.")
```

Use `(yield-all xs)` instead of `(doseq [x xs] (yield x))` to set multiple elements in the sequence.
